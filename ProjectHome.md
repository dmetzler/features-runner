This project takes advantage of the @RunWith JUnit annotation, to introduce a Feature notion that is a bunch of setup/teardown.

It also embeds Guice that creates tests object. Feature can declare Guice bindings.

This project has been outsourced from the Nuxeo project (http://www.nuxeo.org/)

You'll find basic explanations here :
